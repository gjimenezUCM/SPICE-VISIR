And it has indeed been difficult, as there are four pedals, and the warps are black, to make a rug called Kirkonkaari. So someone can come practice with me, I can teach the making of it now too. But I unraveled and wound many times. But I hope there would be more of these weavers there. And in T\u00f6yrytie 4 there is a weaving place, so one can come and see them. And we have had a couple of men learning there, and the boys have done the weaving well too.\u00a0",

And that it\u2019s a shirt for a girlish boy. But now, in recent years, the same boys that are now in their fifties, have wanted to look back, and look for the shirt from the attic of the cottage, and put it on. Quite clearly.

And the Jopo bicycles had just entered the market. And I dreamed that with the money I earned from the job, I would buy a Jopo. And that Jopo was the same kind of orange colour as this one. And it was wonderful that I had my own bicycle  for the first time. It was approximately at the turn of the 1970s. Yeah, 1975 it says here. Well yeah, I remembered pretty well.
