And she had this situation in the 1950s, after being evacuated, that with the wives of her uncles, they used this kind of material, dismantled felt from a paper machine. The felt from the paper machine was dismantled into yarn and dyed with dyes from plants. So this rug I now have in my archives, I\u2019m wondering where should one put it. It dates from 1952, 1953. And its model is \u201cIt\u00e4maan tiet\u00e4j\u00e4t\u201d, or something like that, you can find it in the rug catalogs. And how skilfully these women have made decorations and embellishments for themselves, then after the war. ",
